title: "Understanding the Relationship Between GDP Per-Capita and Life Expectancy"
description: |
 This project investigates whether the positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy holds true across different continents. Historically, countries with populations that enjoy higher life expectancy tend to maintain higher GDP per capita. However, this relationship may not be universal. Some nations achieve relatively high life expectancy despite having lower-than-average GDP per capita, while others have comparatively poor life expectancy despite higher average incomes.

  This project uses data from the Gapminder dataset. I perform a permutation test to evaluate whether the observed correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita is stronger than what would be expected by chance within each continent.
 
 
 The question I hope to answer is:
  In the broader population of countries similar to those in the 2007 Gapminder data, is GDP per capita associated with life expectancy?

  Null hypothesis (H₀): In the population, GDP per capita and life expectancy are unrelated. Meaning, the true slope in a regression of life expectancy on GDP per capita is 0 within each continent. Any pattern we see in the sample arises from natural country-to-country fluctuation.
  Alternative hypothesis (H₁): In the population, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have simerlaly higher life  expectancy (non-zero slope). The association we see is stronger than what would be expected from random variation alone.
 
 This study will use the slope of this comparison as the test statistic. The slope in this case measures the direction of association, meaning if the slope is positive, that should indicate higher life expectancy and higher GDP. The steeper the slope, the stronger the link. To test these hypotheses, I use a permutation test. Under the null hypothesis, GDP per capita and life expectancy are unrelated, so the life expectancy values could just as well have been assigned to different countries. I mimic this “randomness” by shuffling life expectancy values within each continent, and recording the slope each time. Repeating this 2,000 times creates a null distribution of slopes that would be expected purely from random reassignment of life expectancy to countries if there were no real association in the underlying population.

 
 Refrence: The data used in this analysis comes from the [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/), which is a independent education non-profit that aggreigates large data sets drawing from the UN, World Bank and other large international institutions.

The scatter plot shows the observed relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita across countries in 2007. There is a clear upward trend: countries with higher income levels tend to have longer life expectancy, although there is still substantial variation. Some countries achieve high life expectancy despite modest GDP per capita, and others show the opposite.This graph warrants testing whether the relationship is strong enough to be considered statistically meaningful. 

This faceted graph shows the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita in 2007, separated by continent. Each point represents a country, and the line within each panel indicates the general direction of the relationship. Overall, continents like Europe and Asia show a strong positive correlation, while Africa and Oceania display weaker associations between life expectancy and GDP per capita.

```{r}
#Identifying the LifeExp slope with a linear model

get_slope <- function(df) {
  fit <- lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp, data = df)
  coef(fit)[["lifeExp"]]  
}

```

The code above tests the slope of the simple regression. gdpPercap ~ lifeExp

Null : beta1 = 0 
Alt  : beta1 ≠ 0 

```{r}
obs_slopes <- gap2007 |>
  group_by(continent) |>
  summarize(
    obs_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp))[2]
  )

obs_slopes


continents <- unique(gap2007$continent)

obs_slopes_continent <- numeric(length(continents))

for (i in 1:length(continents)) {
  df_cont <- subset(gap2007, continent == continents[i])
  
  obs_slopes_continent[i] <- get_slope(df_cont)
}

names(obs_slopes_continent) <- continents

obs_slope_overall <- get_slope(gap2007)
obs_slope_overall
obs_slopes_continent

```

The above code uses a for loop to compute the observed slope for each continent. For each iteration, the code filtered the data set to a single continent, ran the get_slope() function and saved the slope value. This allows me to compare how the strength of the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita differs geographically.Given the slope output, we can predict the average change in GDP per capita (US$) for a 1 year increase in life. For example in Asia, we can predict 1 additional year of life yields 1225.2 additional gdp per capita. 

Larger positive slopes signify a steeper income to health relationship.

# Permutation Test : Null Distribution
perm_null <- function(rep, data){
  data |>
    group_by(continent) |>
    select(continent, lifeExp, gdpPercap) |>
    mutate(lifeExp_perm = sample(lifeExp, replace = FALSE)) |>
    summarize(
      obs_slope  = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp      ))[2],
      perm_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp_perm ))[2],
      .groups = "drop"
    ) |>
    mutate(rep = rep)
}

set.seed(2025)
B <- 2000


null_by_cont_tbl <- map(1:B, perm_null, data = gap2007) |>
  list_rbind()

head(null_by_cont_tbl)
```
To simulate the null hypothesis that life expectancy and GDP per capita are unrelated, I created a permutation function. The function (perm_null) randomly shuffles life expectancy values within the dataset. For each randomization, a linear model is fit for each continent and the new slope is recorded. Repeating this 2,000 times using the map() function creates a null distribution of slopes that would occur purely by chance. 

```{r}
#Calculating P-Values per continent 

pvals_tbl <- null_by_cont_tbl |>
  group_by(continent) |>
  summarize(
    p_value = mean(abs(perm_slope) >= abs(obs_slope)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

pvals_tbl
```
The above table represents the null distribution through permutation. I calculated a two-sided p-value for each continent to test if the observed slope between GDP per capita and life expectancy was different from zero. The p-value above represents the proportion of permuted slopes whose absolute value was at least as large as the observed slope. This provides a measurement for how extreme the observed relationship is relative to what would be expected by complete chance. The results show quite small p-values for Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe. This indicates strong evidence of a real positive association. Oceania’s higher p-value suggests no statistically significant relationship, almost certainly due to its small sample size. Overall, the analysis suggests that while income and health are positively related worldwide, the strength of this relationship varies by region. 

```{r}
#Plotting -- Faceted null distribution plots 

obs_slopes <- gap2007 |>
  group_by(continent) |>
  summarize(obs_slope = coef(lm(gdpPercap ~ lifeExp))[2], .groups = "drop")

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(
    data = null_by_cont_tbl,
    aes(x = perm_slope),
    bins = 40, fill = "lightblue", color = "white"
  ) +  
  geom_vline(
    data = obs_slopes,
    aes(xintercept = obs_slope),
    color = "red", linewidth = .8
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, scales = "free") +
  labs(
    title = "Permutation Test: Null Distribution of Slopes by Continent",
    subtitle = "Red line = observed slope; histogram = null slopes (lifeExp shuffled)",
    x = "Permuted slopes", y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
The histograms show slopes expected by chance if life expectancy and GDP were unrelated, while the red lines show the true slopes. In Asia, Europe, and the Americas, the observed slopes fall far outside the null distributions, indicating a strong real relationship. Africa shows a weaker but still significant effect. Oceania does not show significance because it includes only two countries, making its estimate unreliable.


Conclusion: 

This analysis provides evidence that, in the broader population of countries represented in the 2007 Gapminder data, GDP per capita and life expectancy are positively associated. By using a permutation test, I generated a null distribution that represents what slopes would look like should the two variables be completely unrelated. Meaning that the act of generating GDP per capita was independent of life expectancy. I then compared the observed slopes to this null distribution by calculating two-sided p-values for each continent to assess whether the relationships observed could potentially have arisen by some random variation. 

The results show statistically significant positive associations in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Showing that higher income levels correspond to longer average lifespans. Oceania, with only two countries represented, does not indicate a significant relationship due to the insufficient data. These findings suggest that while economic development and public health are strongly linked globally, the strength of this connection depends on regional context. Importantly, the conclusions extend beyond the specific 2007 dataset. They provide evidence that, in the larger population of nations, life expectancy and GDP per capita are not independent but systematically related.
