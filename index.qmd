Hi! My name is Thomas Price and I am a current Senior at Pitzer College. At Pitzer, I study International Political Economy and Data Science. When I am not studying, you can find me playing tennis on our club tennis team, traveling around the country with the Claremont Debate Team or playing Pickle ball Tournaments!\
\
The purpose of this website is the showcase projects that I have worked on in various data science classes, personal projects and a general portfolio of my interests. \
\
Feel free to surf around and check out some work, send me a note via email or peruse my linked-in, all linked below!
