title: "Using R for Thesis Prospectus "
subtitle: "From Infrastructure to Influence: Evaluating Public Support for China in BRI Recipient States"
description: |
  This project investigates whether China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) enhances soft power among recipient nations using cross-national data analyzed in R. 
  
  I used R to clean and merge data from AidData, Pew Research, and Afrobarometer, creating country-level variables for Chinese investment and public favorability.
  Graph 1 visualizes the top thirty recipients of BRI finance, revealing the concentration of lending among geopolitically strategic states.
  
  Graph 3 displays cross-national attitudes toward China, showing wide variation in public favorability across key BRI participants.
  
  Graph 4 is a scatterplot linking total BRI lending to public opinion, illustrating that high financial exposure does not necessarily translate into positive sentiment.
  
  I have only included some of the graphs I created below, however, if you are intrested in my theory, findings, or analysis,
